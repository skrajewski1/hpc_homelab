/boot = contains your system files i.e. grub and kernel
go into grub2 and then grub.cfg and you can change which kernel you want to use

it'll look like this ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###



Service File Locations for Systemd (listed in priority)
1. /etc/systemd/system             (you can put override files here since they have highest priority)
2. /run/systemd/system
3. /lib/systemd/system             (typically when you install a package this is where it'll store the unit files)

the types of files you'll see are
socket
service
timer
target

reload is different from restart in that it reloads the configuration files without kicking off the users 
cat /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf    (only contains what has changed)
rm /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf    (removes the override file) 

systemctl edit httpd.service              edit the service file; creates an override file
systemctl edit --full httpd.service       edit the service file; edits the original


#cockpit

dnf install cockpit -y
systemctl status cockpit.socket
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket     (will listen on port 9090)
go to ip address of your host machine
use a login info for a user on the account

#Houston Command Center
on rocky linux
dnf update -y
dnf install epel-release -y
switch to root
sed -i 's/^\(SELINUX=\).*$/\1permissive/' /etc/selinux/config && setenforce 0
sudo dnf install -y https://zfsonlinux.org/epel/zfs-release-2-3.el9.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install -y zfs
sudo modprobe zfs
sudo dnf reinstall -y coreutils
sudo dnf install -y --skip-broken cockpit cockpit-pcp cockpit-zfs-manager cockpit-benchmark cockpit-navigator cockpit-file-sharing cockpit-45drives-hardware cockpit-machines cockpit-sosreport

firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket



#Blockchain
The concept of blockchain was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta as a way to timestamp digital documents securely. 
However, Satoshi Nakamoto implemented the first functional blockchain in 2008 as part of Bitcoin.


#Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a publicly available list of known security vulnerabilities in software and hardware.
yum updateinfo list security
yum update --security

#PCAP (Packet Capture) Overview
PCAP (Packet Capture) files store network traffic data captured by tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, or Zeek (Bro).
contain raw packets, including headers and payloads, allowing analysis of network activity, security threats, and troubleshooting issues

#Flashing BIOS
updating or reinstalling the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware on a computer’s motherboard
Why Flash the BIOS?
-Fix security vulnerabilities
-Improve system stability and performance
-Support new hardware (e.g., CPUs, RAM)
-Resolve boot issues

How to Flash the BIOS (General Steps):
Check your current BIOS version:
sudo dmidecode -s bios-version  # Linux  
wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion  # Windows CMD  

-Download the latest BIOS update from the motherboard manufacturer’s website.
-Prepare a USB drive (formatted as FAT32) and copy the BIOS update file.
-Enter BIOS/UEFI by pressing F2, F10, DEL, or ESC during boot.
-Use the BIOS update utility (e.g., EZ Flash, Q-Flash, or M-Flash).
-Select the update file and confirm the flash process.
-Restart your PC after the update completes.


#Configuration Management Tools
2015 Redhat bought ansible
chef
puppet
salt (salt project)

people usually use chef or puppet
redhat uses ansible 
bloomberg uses salt

#Nessus




#Samba
enables your RHEL/linux system to share files and printers with windows machines and vice versa
open-source tool that lets you connect Linux and Windows based systems for file and print services
it implements the server message block (SMB) protocol which allows linux machines to act as file servers, domain controllers or clients

#Install Samba
#Don't have Houston command center installed when doing this as there is a dependency issue that comes up when you try to install

dnf update -y
dnf install samba samba-common samba-client -y
# to disable 45drives_stable use dnf config-manager --set-disabled 45drives_stable
cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

#add this to config file and edit as necessary
[SharedFolder]
path = /srv/samba/share
writable = yes
browsable = yes
guest ok = yes
create mask = 0644
directory mask = 0755


sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/share
sudo chmod -R 0755 /srv/samba/share
sudo chown nobody:nobody /srv/samba/share  # For guest access; adjust as needed

sudo systemctl start smb nmb
sudo systemctl enable smb nmb

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
