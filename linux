/boot = contains your system files i.e. grub and kernel
go into grub2 and then grub.cfg and you can change which kernel you want to use

it'll look like this ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###



Service File Locations for Systemd (listed in priority)
1. /etc/systemd/system             (you can put override files here since they have highest priority)
2. /run/systemd/system
3. /lib/systemd/system             (typically when you install a package this is where it'll store the unit files)

the types of files you'll see are
socket
service
timer
target

reload is different from restart in that it reloads the configuration files without kicking off the users 
cat /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf    (only contains what has changed)
rm /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf    (removes the override file) 

systemctl edit httpd.service              edit the service file; creates an override file
systemctl edit --full httpd.service       edit the service file; edits the original

go to ip address of your host machine
use a login info for a user on the account
