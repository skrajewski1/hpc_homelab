InfiniBand is a high-speed interconnect technology used in HPC and data center environments

1. high bandwidth 10Gbps to 100s Gbps
2. low latency communication i.e. the delay between sending a message and receiving a response (required for HPC because of parallel processing)
3. scalability: allows for thousands of nodes interconnected in a cluster
4. Remote direct memory access (RDMA) enables direct data transfer between different nodes memory without invovling the processor
5. Reliable transport: has various error dection and correction mechanisms to ensure reliable and accurate data transmission
