Slurm = Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
Slurm is a tool that schedules jobs to run on a compute cluster that's used in HPC environments
 

Commands:
[these commands let you schedule, allocate resources, and cancel jobs]
*Sbatch  = submits a batch script to the slurm scheduler to run a job non-interactively when resources are available
Srun = launches a command/job immediately across specified resources often interactively or within a script
Salloc = allocates resources for a job and provides an interactive shell to use them without running a script update
*Scancel = terminates a running or pending job by specifying its job ID

[these commands look at the sate of the system]
*Squeue = displays the current sate of jobs in the queue such as thier status, user, and resources. WHAT JOBS EXIST
*Sinfo = shows information about the clusters nodes and partitions, like avaialbility and configuration
Sacct = retrives detailed accounting data for completed or running jobs, such as runtime and resource usage

*commands that are are your workhorses



Best practices:
1. put related work into a multiple job steps both for performance and ease of management


sbatch -c 2 --mem-per-cpu 2G -t 1-0:0:0 -J climateModel --wrap "python climate.py"
-c <number of cpus to use>
--mem-per-cpu <number of memory to use per cpu>
-t <time you want to allocate; just give it your best guess; 10:0:0 = 10 hours and 3-0:0:0 = 3 days>
-J <job name>
--wrap "python python.py"   (the call to make i.e. what it is you are going to be submitting)

remember that sbatch works in the background while srun works in the foreground and you won't be able to use the terminal when you execute the command
